Installation

To work with this project locally, first install all dependecies:

```
npm install
```

To build and run the project, project runs on port 3000.

```
npm start
```

To make the final build before pushing to production:

```
npm run production 
```

I recommend reading [firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/) to host and use realtime database for this project.
